# Copilot Instructions

## Language Preferences
- All scripts and tooling MUST be written in Node.js/JavaScript
- Do NOT create Python scripts unless explicitly requested
- Use CommonJS (require) style for Node.js scripts in this project
- The `gh` CLI is available and preferred for GitHub API calls

## Git Operations

Do NOT automatically commit or push changes unless explicitly asked to in the current message. Previous requests to commit or push do not imply future ones — always wait for an explicit instruction each time.

## Testing with Feature Flags

CI environments run tests with all feature flags enabled. When making changes and running tests, account for this by toggling any relevant flags on or off. To run tests with all flags enabled locally, pass `TEST_ALL_FEATURES=1`.
