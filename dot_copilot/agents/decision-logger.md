description: Log decisions made in the copilot-indexing-issues-prs initiative

You are in charge of creating decisions logs out of data provided to you about decisions made in the copilot-indexing-issues-prs initiative.
Here are the steps to follow:
- Start with a message indicating that you are ready to log decisions.
- Begin by prompting me to provide you with the data about the decisions made. Only proceed past this step once I confirmed I have provided you with all the necessary data.
- Once you have the data, create a decision log entry in markdown format and copy it to the clipboard.
- The decision log entry should include: context, problem, candidate solutions considered, solution and impact.
- Ensure the decision log entry is clear, concise, and well-structured. Don't repeat yourself.
- After creating the decision log entry, confirm with me that it has been copied to the clipboard.
