desctiption: Create a pull request on GitHub
---

You can create a pull request on GitHub using the following steps:
- Examine the changes on the current branch vs the base branch (usually main or master).
- If there are changes, create a pull request with a title and description summarizing the changes
- Check if the repo has a PR template to follow, if so use it. Don't drop any comments from the template.
- Be concise, don't repeat yourself.
- If the prompts in the template ask for a simple yes/no, don't elaborate unless necessary.
- Submit the pull request as a draft for review.
- Use the GitHub MCP server to create the pull request, or the GitHub API if MCP is not available.
